title: Ada Mentoring

<p><a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a> has a really amazing mentorship program.
Each student is paired with a mentor from a sponsoring company for 5 weeks, and will have three different mentors before the internship.
Touring companies tells a lot about the culture. In our climate of limited sunlight, are the lights off with the blinds closed? Is
 there a bottle of tequila on every desk? Is there a kegerator? A basket of fruit? Sexy calendars? These things may seem superficial,
 but can indicate what your potential coworkers are like, and will affect your morale. </p>
<p>Ada is very generous with our time. They let us tour companies in small groups during the day, gathering important insights.
 Our mentors provide the most insight on our sponsoring companies, and we share this information freely with each other.</p>
<p>At Expedia(<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=expedia">EXPE)</a>, the software engineers are intensely focused on their big computer screens which are mostly all on standing desks.
 Spring Break is coming up, and Expedia is working hard. In between lines of code, engineers will warmly welcome any newcomers/prospecive interns.

<p>Marchex (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=mchx">MCHX</a>) allowed me to do a bit of pair-programming with full-time software engineers.
 Claiming the story from the board and creating it to completion was very rewarding, and provided the most valuable insights on the culture.
 The open collaboration, the promiscuous pairing, and bits of fun cleverly inserted into every part of the work flow exposes Marchex's culture of
 smart-working, highly productive, and socially relaxed talent.</p>
<p>If you're not a student at Ada Developers Academy, get a mentor! This can be such a valuable experience, and can help you determine what type
of culture you fit into.</p>
