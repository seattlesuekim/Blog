title: SQL Injections are Bad, MMkay

<p>We all should know better than to commit our session store and our secret_token from our Rails config/initializers directory to Github.
    But we don't. Valid cookies are easy to bake. Throw some chocolate chips, flour, sugar and earth balance together and BAM.
</p>
<p>All you need to do to make a valid cookie is the following procedure described by
    <a href="http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/22/how-to-hack-a-rails-app-using-its-secret-token/">Rob Heaton</a>:*
    <ul>
    <li>Look at the cookie in your browser. Note its structure -- it's a hex string with a hyphen in the middle.</li>
    <li>Create your evil hash and Marshal.dump it</li>
    <li>Encode in base 64, then escape characters</li>
    <li>Calculate your signature using OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest</li>
    <li>Concatenate the signature to the value</li>
    </ul>


<p>Well, that was easy. I did this and it works. A slightly less obvious mistake we make with Rails applications is that we allow
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injections</a>.
    Go ahead and run <a href="http://brakemanscanner.org">Brakeman</a>. You might see this vulnerability in your application.
    You already use strong params to prevent malicious Mallory from sending malicious (like delete) HTTP requests.
    But that won't stop Mallory from trying to send DELETE * FROM Tablename; INSERT ...
    Mallory can send <em>any number</em> of SQL queries by simply adding a semicolon and concatenating more stuff, because
    ActiveRecord's implementation of the SQL server allows for multiple queries to be processed in one call.
    As always, you can stop Mallory.
<ul>
    <li>First of all, don't use string interpolation to make SQL or ActiveRecord queries.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement">prepared statements</a>.</li>
    <li>Finally, properly escape your characters. An example of code which doesn't filter Mallory's input for escape characters is
    <code>statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name ='" + userName + "';"</code>. Avoid that.</li>
</ul>
