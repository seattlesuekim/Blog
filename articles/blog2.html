title: Post-Third Week Analysis


<p>
Now I have another week of Ruby in my collection of awesome learnings. My new short-term goals are to begin using TDD
(test driven development) using rspec. I also look forward to hearing from our guest speakers who are so eager that they
are already tweeting with excitement. This will be a good week.</p>
<p>
I've experienced my first long (though only one week) pair-programming project. My pair and I were a good fit -- we share
similar communication styles and were both motivated and interested in the project. We even got an extra credit point for
implementing several extra methods, and for writing methods that were so small and clear that comments weren't necessary.
All in all, it was a fun and challenging week. I almost feel as if I'm qualified to compare Ruby and Python. Here it is:
Aside from the stuff about Ruby being object-oriented -- whereas in Python, not everything is an object, I believe that
Ruby allows one to produce very elegant and readable code. For example, Ruby uses blocks and Python doesn't. I thought list
comprehensions were cool, but with Ruby, who needs 'em?</p>
<p>
I am completely immersed in programming and am looking to follow local Rubyists, software engineers, and anyone who loves
 software and math.</p>
