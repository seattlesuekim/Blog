title: PGP Neighbors

<p>I created <a href="pgpneighbors.us">PGP Neighbors</a> for my capstone project at Ada. Check out the site -- you'll see that
 there are no frills. You won't spend hours captivated by fading images or interactive maps. This site is purely informational,
and the fun is in gamifying the Web of Trust. If you're not familiar with concepts surrounding PGP, read the <a href="pgpneighbors.us/about">about</a>
 page. PGP Neighbors allows users to see "friends of friends." By "friends," I mean people whose identities have been verified. Same thing, right?
You can enter your keyid and the number of degrees of separation you'd like to see. PGP Neighbors recursively checks the Postgresql
database for signatures on keys, and generates a list. If someone in that list is a link to their Wikipedia page,
then congrats -- someone famous is in your immediate vicinity in the Web of Trust.
</p>
<p>By now, you might feel compelled to gather more signatures, bringing you closer to celebrities. That feeling is normal, and is the intention
of this application. The next step up would be to assign scores to people depending on whether they are on Wikipedia, how many sigs they have,
how many of their sigs are famous, how large their key is, etc. Also a scoreboard would be sweet. For now, just play with it. Unfortunately, you'll see a lot
of "unknown" names. This is because they are missing from niif's keydump. If you know of a better maintained keydump, please let me know! That'll fix a lot. And don't be
too star-struck if you find that you're only a couple degrees of separation away from Linus Torvalds. It means you're pretty cool, but try not to
let it inflate your head.
</p>
<p>So, this application was very algorithm-heavy. The entire Web of Trust has never been parsed before, at least as an open-source library.
That's because it's really difficult. As a person with one out of over 1.3 million keys in the WoT, I was the first to do this. I wrote a
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/sks_dump_parser">Ruby Gem</a> called sks_dump_parser. I discussed this in my previous blog entry.
 It uses an advanced state machine to parse 143 very unpredictable text files. It is on <a href="https://github.com/suewhite/sks-dump-parser">Github</a>,
so feel free to contribute. It's not perfect.</p>
