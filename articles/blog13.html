title: Reading Material

<p>Suppose you are new to the field of computer science and want to become more integrated into the culture.
You already read <em>Science</em>, <em>Nature</em>, <em>Journal of the ACS</em>, and <em>American Anthropologist</em>. Where to start?</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> has a lot of news that people talk about over beer. Don't be left out of the convo.</li>
    <li><a href="http://thehackernews.com">Hacker News</a> is all about what's new in the world of security. You won't be lost when people
    talk about how SHA1 has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Attacks">broken</a> in just 2^52 operations, yet <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2014/02/98-of-ssl-enabled-websites-still-using.html">
    98% of web apps using SSL still use SHA1</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.securitytube.net">Security Tube</a> is just what it sounds like -- videos of hacking. It's fun*</li>
    <li>Choose your own adventure. Google stuff you're interested in. Computer Science isn't an exclusive pseudo-high-society.
    You don't have to pay big money (or take old issues from your lab) for academic journals. Information is widely shared. <em>For free.</em></li>
</ul>
