title: Finding an Open Source Project

<p>
    Looking for an open source project to contribute to is so simple, even I could do it! I just looked at the
    “explore” section on Github, where I quickly found projects that I use regularly and have noticed bugs.
    Then, I checked to see how active the project was, and if there are issues that worth looking into.
</p>
<p><ul>
    Some projects that came up in my search were:
    <li>Reddit</li>
    <li>Rubocop</li>
    <li>Kathy Butler</li>
    <li>Ideavim (I use this every day)</li>
    <li>One Bus Away for Windows Phone (I use this every day)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
    The plan is to start from the top and if it isn’t feasible to contribute, then to move on. More updates coming soon!
