title: Ideavim

<p>Vim is for cool people. It's been around since the 80's, so it's vintage. If you like tweed, moustaches and highly customizable text editors, you'll love Vim.</p>

<p>I use IntelliJ IDEA as my primary IDE. Now I'm using a Vim emulator plugin called <a href="http://ideavim.sourceforge.net">Ideavim</a>.
    Someday soon, I will form the new habits of keeping my hand off the track-pad, as well as staying in command mode when not typing any code.
    With the help of a free book called <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/1038/">Practical Vim</a>, as well as <a href="http://qnan.org/~pmw/vim">this awesome vim cheatsheet</a>,
    I am on track to be Vimming with the pros.</p>

<p>More importantly, this is the week I started learning Javascript. <a href="https://twitter.com/jefflembeck">Jeff Lembeck</a>
took an entire work week to teach us Javascript. He got us excited about using a programming language which bring the web into the 21st century.
Based on a recommendation from <a href="https://twitter.com/marthakelly">Martha Kelly</a>, I have begun reading Douglas Crockford's
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">"Javascript: the Good Parts."</a> In the upcoming week, I'll be on a team which will implement a RSS feed. I'm looking forward to using some cool authentication technology.</p>
