title: Deploy Your App to Heroku Without a Database

<p>I wrote an app called <a href="http://table-label.herokuapp.com">Table Label</a>. Its current functionality uses no database.
The first time I deployed Table Label to Heroku, I created a dummy Postgres database just to please Heroku (this wasn't my idea).
That was lame, so I got rid of my database out of principle.
</p>
<p>
Here are the steps to get rid of any traces of databse in your Rails application.
    <ul>
    <li>
        First, check your Gemfile. Make sure there are no sqlite3 or pg gems outside of your test environment. <code>gem 'sqlite3'</code> comes automatically in your Gemfile when you run <code>rails new</code>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Go ahead and delete database.yml. You don't need it. Also delete your entire /db directory.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Now, your app will not work when you run your localhost (Rails will look for database.yml). Your app will also not deploy to Heroku. You are in limbo.
        This is because Rails is requiring ActiveRecord. Simple fix -- go to /config/application.rb and delete or comment out the line <code>require "active_record/railite"</code>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        In /config/environments/development.rb, remove <code>config.active_record.migration_error = :page_load</code>.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        In /config/initializers/wrap_parameters.rb, remove the block beginning with <code>ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) do</code>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Running your localhost shouldn't produce any database-related errors at this point. Go to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, view the "Resources" section of your app, and make sure you don't have any database stuff in your "Add-ons."
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><code>git push heroku master</code>  .......  WIN
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>
