title: One Fortnight Into Ada

<p>For the last two weeks, I've been Rubying from 9-5 in <a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developers Academy</a>. It's great.</p>
<p>

What's really cool about computer science is that if I write a "hello world" program in any language and run it a million
times, it'll output "hello world" every time -- and I was tempted to run it a million times just to prove that to myself.
My inner biochemist is always skeptical that an algorithm could break at random due to unexplained natural phenomena.
In theory, I'm not a holist. I don't believe that the whole is ever greater than the sum of its parts. But chemistry in
practice too often doesn't work out like chemistry in theory. Biology is even worse.

I began pursuing computer science in January of this year. I took a Python class, discrete math, and downloaded some e-books
on data structures. In May, I emerged from the corn fields of low-tech Iowa and moved to Seattle. Since January, my mind has
expanded more than it has in the previous 20-or-so years. I grew up thinking that I'm just "not a math person." But now I'm a
self-proclaimed math-ophile. I love discrete math -- it just makes so much sense. So what if I had to (whoa, embarrassing!)
re-teach myself how to do long division on paper? By learning about modular arithmetic, I actually came to <em>understand</em> division.

</p><p>This week, I wrote two games in Ruby: Hangman and Mastermind. Take a look at them on my GitHub. Mastermind was
definitely more challenging than Hangman. The computer makes the code and provides feedback for the user's guesses of
the secret code. I'd like to expand my program such that the computer can break the user's code! There are some sweet algorithms
out there, and I want to implement one of them in Ruby.

Next week, I'll discuss Python vs. Ruby, as well as analyzing text from csv files. And probably some other stuff.
