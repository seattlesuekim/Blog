title: Q&A

<p>
    Previously, I promoted my spiffy <a href="/ask">Captcha</a>. Well, you've asked some questions and I'm here to answer them for you.
</p>

<p>
    <p>Q: What is Pluto?<br>
    A: Pluto is the god of the underworld and abductor of Percephone, his wife.</p>

    <p>Q: Do you think programming will catch on, or is it a fad?<br>
    A: Agriculture, domestication of animals, sun-dials, programming -- they're all fads.</p>
</p>

    Thanks for your questions, and I'll be better about answering them in a timely manner. Perhaps I'll implement a mailer to notify me :-)
